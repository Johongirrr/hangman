# Hangman app

What is it?  It is really cool app for having nice time when you are free and wanna have some fun. It randomly generates words with __fetch api__ randomly generated words are displayed in the screen, you have to find the correct word by guessing. in keypress event on window you find correct word. You have __5__ guesses to find correct word if you succeeded to find correct word success message is shown on the screeen if all your attemps are in vail failure message is shown with correct word.

### What you need to do use this app
All you have to do is install node-modules and run dev-server on dependencies
npm i
npm run dev-server
# What technology is used?
__JavaScript__, __HTML5__, __CSS3__, __WEBPACK__, __BABEL__, 


And as storage I used localStorage for storing and removing
As not all browsers support new cutting-edge javascript I used __BABEL__ for converting ES5+ syntax to all browser compatible ones. I incorperated __WEBPACK__ to run babel and use modular systems for writing cleaner code.

## Suggestions  are very welcome
I pleasedly take any bugs and suggestions.
